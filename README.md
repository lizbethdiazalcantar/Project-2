# Project-2

Sprint 3: Testing Web Applications


# About the project:
There’s a new release of Urban Routes and your lead has asked you to test it. You are asked to concentrate on two areas that have had significant development work done.

An existing feature that has new code behind it – the carsharing feature. In this case, the code has changed so much, you’re asked to test it like it’s a new feature.
A top secret project your company is working on called Aero Taxi. The feature isn’t ready for release yet so it doesn’t show in the app. However, developers have given you a secret way to access it for testing.

# Project Steps
1. Requirement analysis
Well thought out software starts with requirements being gathered. And as you know, well thought out testing starts with analyzing those requirements. You have two sets of requirement documents to work with in this project.


Decompose the following requirements into atomic blocks:

FR-CS32
FR-CS33
FR-CS35 (optional)
The Aero Taxi booking feature:
FR-AT4
FR-AT6


2. Test planning
For this project, no test planning is required because of its similarity with the previous project’s test plan. You only need to pay attention to the instructions and requirements in this project. 

3. Test case creation
Now it’s time to create your test cases. 

3.2
Your task here is to create test cases for your decomposed Aero Taxi requirements (FR-AT4 and FR-AT6). The Aero Taxi service requires the tester to follow some steps to enable the Aero Taxi features. 


4. Environment setup
For this project, the environment has been set up by the Urban Routes DevOps team. 


Start
5. Test execution
Run the test cases you created in 3.2. Record any bugs in Jira as usual and paste the link to the bug in the Google Sheets file.

6. Test closure
Like in Project 2, you’ll just have to do a very simple report. Go to the “Report” tab and enter the number of test cases you created. Then, add the number of passes and the number of failed tests.
